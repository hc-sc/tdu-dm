### Course Repository

Welcome to the course repository for Introduction to Data Management for Applied Public Health. 

Here, we'll keep a record of all the files necessary to attend and complete the course. 
If you're not familiar working in Github, you can treat this as an online folder for accessing course resources. 

See the image below for instructions on how to download all the course files at once.

### DOWNLOADING COURSE MATERIALS:
To download all course materials at one time from the TDU Data Management repository on Github, navigate to the “Code” button near the top right portion
of the screen and click on it. Then select “Download ZIP” from the dropdown menu. See the image below.
Download of the zip file containing course materials should begin within a few moments. Please reach out
to your course leads for assistance if you are unable to access materials stored in our GitHub repository.

Note: We recommend downloading course materials prior to joining the course as we are unable to
assist with issues relating to network download speed.
